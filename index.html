            <p>Hello, and welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm Danish, and I'm thrilled to have you here. Let me take a moment to introduce myself.</p>
    
            <p>I'm a 22-year-old Singapore Management University undergraduate pursuing a computing degree.

            <p>I believe in the power of giving back to the community, and I'm committed to making a positive impact in my community and beyond. Whether through volunteering, advocacy, or others, I'm always eager to give back and contribute to the betterment of society.</p>
